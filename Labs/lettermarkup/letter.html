	<h1>RE: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
	<p> Dear Eileen </p>
	<br>
	<p> Thank you for your recent application to jopin us at University of Awesome's scinece faculty to study as part
	of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sectons. </p>	

	<h2> Starting dates </h2>
	<br>
	<p> We are happy to accoodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the begining of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows: </p>	
	<br>

	<ul>
		<li>First semester: 9 Septmber 2016</li>
		<li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
		<li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
	</ul>

	<p> Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date would you prefer. </p>	
	<p> You can find more information about  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">important university dates  </a> on our website. </p>	

	<h2>Subjects of study</h2>

	<p> At the awsome science faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall
	somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an inteligent, dedicated reasearcher and just the
	kind of person wed like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas youn submitted we were most intrigued by
	are as follows, in order of priority.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Turning H20 into wine, and the health benefits of resveratol (C14H1203.)</li>
		<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayerrs at tempretures exceeding 30*C(80*F), when the
			audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10^3 > 3 x 10^4)</li>
		<li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
	</ol>

	<p> So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long youd expect this
	reaserach to take, required staff nd other resources, and anything else you think wed need to know? Thanks. </p>

	<h2> Exotic dance moves </h2>	

	<p> Yes you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, i did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
		<dd>A little known but very influuential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle
		like chickens, to encourage thier livestock or be "fruitfull"</dd>
		<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
		<dd>Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practise this dance, which
		involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptable
	    thiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thouyght this dance inspired modern
		styles such as twerking</dd>
		<dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
		<dd> An intresting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s belived to have discovered a
		 new dance styule charaterised by "robotic", stilted movemnets, being practised by inhabitants of Northern Alaska
		and Canada. Later on however it was dicovered that they were just moving like this because they were realy cold.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p> For more of my research, see my  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/"> exotic dance research page </a></p>
	<p> Yours sincerely. </p>
